<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Animal Isolator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Isolator</li><li>Negative Pressure Isolator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Animal isolators are specialized containment systems used in research facilities to ensure the safety of animals and researchers. Positive pressure isolators create a clean and controlled environment by continuously pumping filtered air inside to prevent contamination from entering. Negative pressure isolators, on the other hand, remove air from the enclosure, preventing the escape of any potential contaminants. Both types of isolators aim to maintain a controlled and secure environment for animal research, albeit using different air pressure techniques.</p></p>
