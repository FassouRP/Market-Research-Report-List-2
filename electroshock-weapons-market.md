<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electroshock Weapons Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Contact Weapons</li><li>Directed Energy Weapons</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electroshock weapons can be broadly categorized into two types: direct contact weapons and directed energy weapons. Direct contact weapons, such as stun guns and tasers, deliver an electric shock through direct physical contact with the target. These weapons rely on close proximity to effectively immobilize an individual. In contrast, directed energy weapons, like electric shock batons and plasma shockwave generators, are capable of releasing electric shock waves at a distance. Directed energy weapons offer greater flexibility in terms of range and can incapacitate targets without requiring physical contact.</p></p>
