<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dialysis Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis Dialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dialysis machines are used to treat individuals suffering from kidney failure. Hemodialysis dialysis is the most common type, involving the removal of blood from the body to be cleaned and returned. It requires a dialyzer machine that functions as an artificial kidney. Peritoneal dialysis, on the other hand, utilizes the body's peritoneal membrane as a filter. A catheter is implanted into the abdomen, and a dialysis solution is introduced, drawing waste and excess fluids. Both types aim to replace normal kidney functions but differ in the methods used.</p></p>
