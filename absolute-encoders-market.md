<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absolute Encoders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Shaft</li><li>Hollow Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Absolute encoders are devices used to measure the position of an object without the need for referencing. There are two main types: solid shaft and hollow shaft encoders. Solid shaft encoders have a fixed shaft that rotates with the measured object. They are suitable for applications where the encoder is directly connected to the shaft. On the other hand, hollow shaft encoders have a hole in the center, allowing the encoder to fit around the shaft. This type is commonly used when the encoder needs to be attached to an existing shaft.</p></p>
