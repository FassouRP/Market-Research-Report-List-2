<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Turbine Water Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Nozzle</li><li>Multi-nozzle</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The turbine water meter market consists of two primary types - single nozzle and multi-nozzle meters. Single nozzle meters, as the name suggests, have a single nozzle through which the water flows, and these meters tend to be smaller and simpler in design. On the other hand, multi-nozzle meters have multiple nozzles that allow for higher flow rates and are generally used in applications where larger volumes of water need to be measured accurately. These meters offer greater versatility and precision but can be larger and more complex in construction.</p></p>
