<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Resuscitator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-inflating Resuscitator</li><li>Flow-inflating Resuscitator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The disposable resuscitator market consists of two types: self-inflating resuscitators and flow-inflating resuscitators. Self-inflating resuscitators are handheld devices that deliver breaths to patients during CPR by squeezing the bag. They are easy to use, compact, and provide high oxygen concentrations. On the other hand, flow-inflating resuscitators require a flow of oxygen or air to inflate the bag, making them suitable for ventilating patients in critical conditions. Both types are disposable, ensuring hygiene and reducing the risk of cross-contamination.</p></p>
