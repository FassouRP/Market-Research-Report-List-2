<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Conduction Hearing Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Traditional Bone Conduction Hearing Aids</li><li>Bone Anchored Hearing Aids</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bone conduction hearing devices are designed to help individuals with hearing loss by transmitting sound vibrations through the bones of the skull, bypassing the outer and middle ear. Traditional bone conduction hearing aids are non-surgical devices that are placed on or behind the ear and transmit sound vibrations via direct contact with the skin. On the other hand, bone anchored hearing aids (BAHA) are surgically implanted devices that provide better sound quality by utilizing a small titanium implant that fuses with the bone behind the ear.</p></p>
