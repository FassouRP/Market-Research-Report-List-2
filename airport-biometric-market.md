<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airport Biometric Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The airport biometric market consists of two main types: contact and contactless. Contact biometric systems require physical contact between the scanning device and the user, such as fingerprint or palm print scanners. In contrast, contactless biometric systems do not require physical contact and use methods like facial recognition or iris scanning. Both types aim to enhance airport security by accurately verifying the identity of individuals. However, contactless biometric systems offer the added benefits of convenience and hygiene, as they eliminate the need for physical touch during the identification process.</p></p>
