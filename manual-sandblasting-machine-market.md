<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manual Sandblasting Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry</li><li>Wet</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Manual sandblasting machines are commonly used in various industries for surface preparation, cleaning, and polishing tasks. The market for manual sandblasting machines can be categorized into two types: dry and wet. Dry sandblasting machines utilize compressed air to project abrasive materials onto the surface being cleaned, removing rust, paint, or other impurities. Wet sandblasting machines, on the other hand, combine abrasive materials with water to create a slurry that is sprayed onto the surface, providing a more controlled and less dusty cleaning process. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different applications depending on the specific requirements and preferences of the user.</p></p>
