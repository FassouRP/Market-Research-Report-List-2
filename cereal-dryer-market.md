<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cereal Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cross-flow</li><li>Down-stream</li><li>Mixed-flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cereal dryer market comprises three main types: cross-flow, downstream, and mixed-flow. Cross-flow dryers are designed to move the hot air perpendicular to the cereal flow. Downstream dryers pass the cereal through a heated zone, drying it gradually. Mixed-flow dryers combine elements of both cross-flow and downstream dryers, allowing the cereal to move through heated zones perpendicular and parallel to the cereal flow. Each type has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of efficiency, cost, and drying quality, providing options for cereal producers based on their specific needs.</p></p>
