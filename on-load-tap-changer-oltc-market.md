<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The On-load Tap Changer (OLTC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum OLTC</li><li>Oil-immersed OLTC</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>On-load Tap Changer (OLTC) is a device used in transformers to adjust the voltage ratio and regulate power supply. There are two main types of OLTCs: Vacuum OLTC and Oil-immersed OLTC. Vacuum OLTCs use vacuum interrupters to control the tap change, reducing the risk of fire and ensuring efficient operation. Oil-immersed OLTCs, on the other hand, utilize oil as the interrupting medium. While both types serve the same purpose, vacuum OLTCs are preferred for their higher reliability and longer lifespan. Oil-immersed OLTCs are still used in certain applications where specific requirements need to be met.</p></p>
