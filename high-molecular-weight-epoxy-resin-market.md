<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Molecular Weight Epoxy Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Viscosity Epoxy Resin</li><li>High Viscosity Epoxy Resin</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The high molecular weight epoxy resin market consists of two main types: low viscosity epoxy resin and high viscosity epoxy resin. Low viscosity epoxy resin is characterized by its ability to flow easily and have a low resistance to flow, making it suitable for applications that require good wetting and low surface tension. On the other hand, high viscosity epoxy resin has a thicker consistency and higher resistance to flow, making it suitable for applications that require higher mechanical strength and durability.</p></p>
