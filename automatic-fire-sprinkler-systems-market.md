<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Fire Sprinkler Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sensitive Smoke</li><li>Sensitive Temperature</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automatic fire sprinkler systems come in two main types: sensitive smoke and sensitive temperature markets. Sensitive smoke systems are designed to detect early signs of smoke and activate the sprinklers to extinguish the fire. These systems are highly effective in preventing fire spread and minimizing damage. Sensitive temperature systems, on the other hand, rely on heat sensors to activate the sprinklers once a certain temperature threshold, indicating a fire, is reached. Both systems are crucial for fire safety and are used in various settings to protect lives and property from fire incidents.</p></p>
