<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fast Curing Type</li><li>Common Curing Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fusion bonded epoxy powder coating is used as a protective coating on metal surfaces. The fast curing type is a coating that quickly hardens after application, reducing the curing time and speeding up the overall production process. On the other hand, the common curing type requires a longer curing time but offers a more durable and long-lasting coating. While the fast curing type is suitable for projects that require rapid turnaround, the common curing type is preferred for applications where durability is paramount. Both types cater to different needs and requirements in the market.</p></p>
