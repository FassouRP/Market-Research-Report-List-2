<p><h1>Animal Antimicrobials Market Share & Market New Trends Analysis Report By Type, By Application, By End-use, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2023 - 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>Animal antimicrobials are medications or substances that are used to treat and prevent infections in animals. They are similar to human antibiotics and are crucial for maintaining the health and welfare of animals in various sectors such as livestock production, aquaculture, and companion animals.</p><p>The current outlook for the animal antimicrobials market is positive. The increasing demand for animal protein, particularly in emerging economies, is driving the growth of the market. The rise in zoonotic diseases, which can be transmitted from animals to humans, is also contributing to the increased usage of antimicrobials in animals.</p><p>However, there are concerns regarding the overuse and misuse of antimicrobials, leading to the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in animals. To address this issue, stricter regulations and guidelines are being implemented by regulatory authorities worldwide. This includes restricting the use of certain antimicrobials in food-producing animals and promoting responsible use practices.</p><p>In the future, the animal antimicrobials market is expected to witness steady growth. Factors such as an increasing focus on animal health and welfare, rising disposable income, and the growing pet ownership trend are expected to drive the demand for antimicrobials in animals. The emergence of new infectious diseases and the development of novel antimicrobial agents will also contribute to market growth.</p><p>Additionally, the shift towards alternative and sustainable solutions, such as vaccines, probiotics, and phage therapy for disease prevention and treatment in animals, may impact the market dynamics. These alternatives aim to reduce the reliance on antimicrobials and mitigate the risks associated with antimicrobial resistance.</p><p>Overall, with the increasing awareness about the responsible use of antimicrobials and the development of innovative solutions, the animal antimicrobials market is expected to grow at a steady CAGR of 5.8% during the forecasted period.</p></p>
