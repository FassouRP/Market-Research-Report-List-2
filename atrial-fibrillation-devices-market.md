<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atrial Fibrillation Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation</li><li>Maze Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Atrial Fibrillation Devices market includes two types: Catheter Ablation and Maze Surgery. Catheter Ablation is a procedure where a thin tube (catheter) is inserted into the heart to destroy abnormal tissue causing atrial fibrillation. This technique uses radiofrequency energy or extreme cold to eliminate the tissue. On the other hand, Maze Surgery is an open-heart surgical procedure where incisions are made to create scar tissue, rearranging the heart's electrical signals. This helps restore normal heart rhythm and prevent atrial fibrillation. Both methods aim to treat and manage atrial fibrillation, a condition characterized by irregular, rapid heartbeats.</p></p>
