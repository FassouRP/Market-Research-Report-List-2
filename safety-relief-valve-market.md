<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safety Relief Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring-Type Relief Valve</li><li>Lever-Type Relief Valve</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Safety Relief Valve market consists of two main types - Spring-Type Relief Valve and Lever-Type Relief Valve. A Spring-Type Relief Valve works by utilizing a spring to control the pressure inside a system. When the pressure exceeds a set limit, the spring compresses and allows the excess pressure to escape, ensuring safety. On the other hand, a Lever-Type Relief Valve operates by using a lever mechanism to control the pressure. When the pressure surpasses the desired level, the lever mechanism is activated, allowing the excess pressure to be released and maintaining safety within the system.</p></p>
