<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tight Gas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Processed Tight Gas</li><li>Unprocessed Tight Gas</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Processed tight gas refers to the market for natural gas that has been extracted from unconventional reservoirs and has undergone some level of processing to remove impurities, such as water, carbon dioxide, and sulfur. This processed gas is then suitable for distribution and use. On the other hand, unprocessed tight gas refers to natural gas that has been extracted but has not undergone any significant processing. It typically contains impurities and requires further treatment before it can be distributed or used. Both processed and unprocessed gas play a role in the overall tight gas market.</p></p>
