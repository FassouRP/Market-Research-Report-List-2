<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrical Panels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Main Breaker</li><li>Main Lugs</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electrical panels market consists of two main types: main breaker and main lugs. Main breaker panels have a built-in circuit breaker that controls the power supply to the entire panel. They are commonly used in residential and commercial buildings, providing a convenient and safe way to control the electricity flow. On the other hand, main lugs panels do not have a built-in circuit breaker and require an external breaker to be installed. These panels are typically used as sub-panels to distribute power within a larger electrical system.</p></p>
