<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arachnoid Cysts Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent Drainage System Surgery</li><li>Endoscopic Cyst Fenestration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The arachnoid cysts treatment market includes two main types of surgical procedures: permanent drainage system surgery and endoscopic cyst fenestration. In permanent drainage system surgery, a shunt is placed to divert fluid from the cyst to another area of the body. This helps in relieving pressure and reducing cyst size. On the other hand, endoscopic cyst fenestration involves creating a small hole in the cyst wall using an endoscope, allowing the fluid to drain into the normal fluid spaces of the brain. Both procedures aim to alleviate symptoms and manage arachnoid cysts effectively.</p></p>
