<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pantograph for Rail Transit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Segmented Type</li><li>Integral Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Segmented Type: In the context of the rail transit market, a segmented type pantograph refers to a system where the pantograph, which is an apparatus that collects current from an overhead wire to power the train, is composed of multiple segments. Each segment can be adjusted independently, allowing for better contact with the overhead wire and ensuring a stable electric current supply.</p><p>Integral Type: An integral type pantograph, on the other hand, is a design where the pantograph is seamlessly integrated into the roof structure of the train. This type offers advantages such as compactness and reduced aerodynamic drag, as the pantograph is directly built into the train's structure, resulting in a more streamlined appearance and improved efficiency.</p></p>
