<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Solar Tracker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Axis</li><li>Dual Axis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Smart Solar Tracker market offers two main types of products: Single Axis and Dual Axis trackers. Single Axis trackers are designed to move along a horizontal axis, enabling solar panels to tilt and follow the Sun's east-west trajectory. This allows for increased energy generation throughout the day. On the other hand, Dual Axis trackers move along both horizontal and vertical axes, allowing the solar panels to optimize their positioning based on the Sun's position throughout the day. This dual movement enhances energy generation by maximizing the panels' exposure to sunlight.</p></p>
